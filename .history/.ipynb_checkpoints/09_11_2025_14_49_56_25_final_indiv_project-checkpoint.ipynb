    "The model method that is most appropriate is KNN classification because this method predicts the class of an observation, which in this case would be whether a player is subscribed to the newsletter based on the majority class among its k nearest neighbours. An assumption that has to be made is that both the predictive variables have the same impact on the prediction (therefore the data must be scaled), so no single variable dominates the distance measure. Some limitations is that KNN is slow for large datasets, and the model's performance depends heavily on the choice of k. The model selection will focus on finding the optimal value of k by cross validating to compare the accuracy across different k values, and the model with the highest average accuracy will be selected. Moreover, accuracy and recall will also be compared. The dataset will be split into training (70%) and testing (30%) which will occur before the model is fit to ensure predictions are not biassed. Lastly, k-fold-cross-validation will be used to tune k."
